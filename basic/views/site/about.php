                                        SpeedySMS is a fast and reliable bulk SMS service. It is powered by non-tiring SMS gateways which run 24/7 around the clock with little or no down time. In addition, we embarked on building a user-focused SMS portal and custom dashboard for users with a view to helping them experience an intuitive interface and quality service delivery. This way, we welcome feedback from our customers on how we can build a robust solution in order to serve them better.
